# Building Netflix from Scratch Using React (Custom Hooks, Redux) and![2021-05-11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64571039/117873451-cb7bce00-b26d-11eb-85ed-b103537b1773.png)
 Firebase

This application (a Gmail clone) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Redux), Firebase Authentication + Firestore. I have built the following pages within this application: Sign-in and Sign-up and the main dashboard where the emails are displayed. Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is as well handled by firebase.


Don't forget to give it a star, it would be much appreciated! :)
